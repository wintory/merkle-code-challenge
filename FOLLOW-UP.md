# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
Library: react with vite.js because of client-side support, easy and fast development, and optimized build with Rollup.

- vite: UI build tool
- @tanstack/react-query: use for handle fetching, caching in React applications.
- lodash: A utility library that provides helpful functions for my task
- Babel: JavaScript compiler help compile modern JavaScript and React code to older versions
- axios: for making API requests in browsers 
- tailwind: CSS framework to build custom designs quickly
- daisyui: UI library built on top of Tailwind CSS
- testing-library: Library for testing React components and hooks
- vitest: testing framework
- eslint: linting tool that checks code  errors or bad practices
- prettier: code formatter

### Q) What's the command to start the frontend application locally?
- yarn install
- yarn dev

### Q) What libraries did you add to the backend? What are they used for?
Library: Node.js with express due to it is lightweight, simple, and quick to set up with a small scope.

- axios: use for making API requests in Node.js
- dotenv: Loads environment variables from .env
- express: use for building server-side applications and APIs 
- jest: A testing framework for JavaScript
- eslint: linting tool that checks code  errors or bad practices
- prettier: code formatter

### Q) What's the command to start the backend application locally?
- yarn install
- yarn dev

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
- refactor some part of code
- move some component to shared
- split ligical, presentational component
- app performance optimisation
- apply good practice (e.g. SOLID, Clean code)  

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
UI because I preferred to do it, but there are many things to improve if I have more time. 


### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
Backend and SQL because I am less comfortable using them than the UI.


### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
I enjoyed taking this test and no any concerns.
